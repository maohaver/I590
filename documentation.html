                <h3 class="panel-title">Design Process</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">

                <p>Our design began by interpreting the large dataset and sketching some potential choropleth layouts. It was quickly apparent that an interactive choropleth requires a great deal of screen space on its own, so combining a US map with additional charts would require some finesse.</p>

                <p>We split up for two weeks to work on individual designs before coming together to integrate our best features. While we each had variations in our sketches, we all shared similar qualities: a minimalist and easily learnable interface that encourages data exploration through ease of interactivity.</p>

                <p>In its simplest form, our initial design was a chropleth of the U.S. which, when a county was clicked, would be surrounded by relevant information organized in various chart types. Conceptually, these charts might further be filtered via some selection by the user.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>To facilitate this design, it was important to categorize the data into ways it could best be represented. We decided on four simple yet informative choropleths (as their variables held one result per county): Total Population, Median Age, Median Household Income, and Per Capita Income.</p>

                <p>We identified many variables which could be represented as pie charts, as seen in the photo to the right. Age distribution could be shown in a bar chart, and the four choropleth variables could each be represented as a simple info box displaying a number and label.</p>


              </div>
            </div>


            <div class="panel panel-primary">
              <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title">Design Rationale</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                
                <p>There were many problems to overcome once we started laying out our original design in HTML. We realized that although flanking the choropleth with two columns of data was aesthetically pleasing, there would not be enough room to effectively display so many charts with legends alongside a usable map.</p>

                <p>At a design meeting, we decided to change to a split screen design with a major focus on the choropleth as a key interactive element. With a map on the left side and panels on the right, user's should be inclined to interact with the map first and recognize that the charts are generated based on their interactions with the map.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Our first iteration of the website was basically a choropleth next to a column of pie charts. While this looked visually pleasing already, we realized we would need to rethink the interaction with the choropleth&mdash;how should we highlight the county once a user clicks on it, and how can we make state trends and county data more visible on a state-by-state level?</p>

                <p>The answer was a D3.js click-to-transform solution, provided by Mike Bostock. Click the image to the right to view the source code. This zooms and centers the map on the county the user has clicked on, and zooms back out when the same county is clicked again.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>While working on the CSS for the pie charts, we stumbled across a guide for making D3.js pie charts. This six-step guide suggested an innovative feature&mdash;an interactive legend that redraws the pie chart based on deselected variables. This feature allows users to explore data they otherwise couldn't, such as what percentage of minorities are "Black or African American" in Marion County.</p>

                <p>Simply click the county, then click the "White" box on the legend to remove it from the chart. Following this example, we see that while the percentage of "Black or African Americans" in Marion County is 27.2%, they account for 75.2% of minorities in the county.</p>

              <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title">Data Insights</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                
                <p>As our visualization is designed to facilitate data exploration, the insights gained from it are often open to interpretation and analysis by individual users. Of course, some findings are objective. A quick scan through the four choropleths reveals that&mdash;as expected&mdash;Median Household Income is closely related to Per Capita Income.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, Median Age appears to follow a similar distribution across the U.S. to these two seemingly unrelated variables. Total Population bucks the trend, with places like Los Angeles County, California and Cook County, Illinois (Chicago) boasting an incredibly high population but a relatively low Median Household Income and Per Capita Income.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>We did not get to delve deeply into the small multiples design due to the time it took to develop the choropleth and pie charts. Unfortunately, this makes it more difficult to ascertain national trends for related variables.</p>

                <p>For example, with the visualization's current design, a user could click county by county and see what percentage of people use motorcycles vs. bicycles for transportation. But if users were to see this data displayed in a small multiples arrangement of choropleths, each depicting one mode of transportation, trends could be rapidly discerned.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Despite the lack of small multiples, the pie charts can be used to reveal trends at the county and, to some extent, state levels. Some were obvious: as Median Household Income/Per Capita Income increases, so do the percentages of people above the poverty level. The average level of educational attainment is also highly correlated to these increases, with more people holding graduate or professional degrees in those counties with the highest median incomes.</p>

                <p>Some variables seem highly independent of all others. For example, Median Age does not appear to correlate with any of the pie chart variables, even ones that are ostensibly related&mdash;like Educational Attainment or Living Arrangement.
